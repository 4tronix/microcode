## Try it out!

There are two ways to run MicroCode:

-   [web app](https://aka.ms/microcode) with [micro:bit V2](https://microbit.org)
-   [micro:bit V2](https://microbit.org) + [Arcade Shield](https://www.kittenbot.cc/products/newbit-arcade-shield)

See below for more information about the MicroCode web app, and how to deploy MicroCode to the micro:bit V2. Regardless of which way you run MicroCode, you will probably want to know a little bit about
MicroCode's:

-   [icon-based language](./language.md)
-   [samples](./samples.md)
-   [FAQ](./faq.md)

## Web editor

The easiest way to get started with MicroCode is through the web editor ([https://aka.ms/microcode](https://aka.ms/microcode), shown below). We recommend using the keyboard navigation or a real gamepad!

-   Arrow keys for D-pad
-   Space bar for A button
-   Backscape for B button
-   Copy the URL to share your program.

### Web App and micro:bit V2

Click on the micro:bit button at the lower right of the web app (see above) and follow the on-screen instructions to configure your micro:bit V2 and pair it with the editor.
Once your micro:bit V2 is paired, the web editor will be able to download Your
MicroCode program to your microbit. This happens on every edit, so your program
is always up-to-date (and running)!

## micro:bit V2 and Arcade Shield

Click on the version number in the web app to download the MicroCode hex file to your micro:bit V2. When you plug the micro:bit into the Arcade Shield, MicroCode should start running. Your MicroCode program is always live and runnable. Once you removed the micro:bit from the shield, the program will persist and continue to run.

## Accessibility

MicroCode can be program with keyboard, game controllers (such as XBox controllers), mouse or touch inputs. The editor was designed to integrate with screen readers.

## Sample programs

The MicroCode app has a set of [samples](./samples) built-in. Select the samples button on the MicroCode home page (see below) to reveal
the gallery of samples.

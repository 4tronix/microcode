# ![reaction time](../images/generated/icon_reaction_time.png){:class="icon-sample"} Reaction time

![Reaction time MicroCode program](../images/generated/sample_reaction_time.png){:class="sample"}

This is a 2 player game that tests your reaction time. In this game, both player wait for a signal (screen image, sound)
to press the button. The fastest player that presses the button **after** wins the round. You loose if you press before.

This program uses 4 pages:

-   page 1: countdown,
-   page 2: wait for player to press button
-   page 3: player left won
-   page 4: player right won

## improvement ideas

-   Use touch pin 0 or 1 instead of button A, B as inputs.
